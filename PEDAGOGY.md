# elimu.ai Pedagogy & Learning Theory ü§ì

## Instruction Language

The age group we are targeting is primary school age (6-11). These children are old enough to speak and understand their mother tongue well, and we believe that it's important to use a child's [mother tongue as the language of instruction](https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/children-learn-better-their-mother-tongue) to achieve the most efficient learning.


## Personalized Learning üöÄ

The elimu.ai software automatically detects the current knowledge level of the child currently using the Android device, and adapts the [apps](https://eng.elimu.ai/apps) and content to best fit her current skill level. This allows for an explicit instruction in for example sounds, letters and words matching the current state of a child's knowledge. This enables a much more efficient overall learning impact, since the most useful instructional events can occur at the exact right time.

_Personalized learning_ is a core component of the elimu.ai software. Each child is guided through the curriculum by our AI tutor Nya and her robot companion. Nya automatically detects the current knowledge level of the child, and adapts the [apps](https://eng.elimu.ai/apps) and content to best fit the child's current skill level. | ![xprize-no-text_banner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15718174/82723985-51250780-9d05-11ea-8fc6-e800d9b414eb.png)
A collection of educational [apps/games](https://eng.elimu.ai/apps) teaches children basic literacy and numeracy in a fun and engaging way. This empowers each child to learn fully autonomously, without depending on the availability of qualified teachers. The AI tutor gradually unlocks more advanced content, as the child demonstrates mastery of prerequisite skills. | [![scr_20170619_211129_512](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15718174/27299402-95bea44c-552c-11e7-84ab-217cdca758e4.gif)](https://github.com/elimu-ai/launcher)
A [Spaced Repetition System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) (SRS) is used to remind the child when it's time to review previously learned content. This helps the child store what she learns in long-term memory. If the child fails to demonstrate mastery during a review event, the sequence is restarted from the beginning (with shorter intervals). | ![SRS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15718174/83326661-69b69400-a2a8-11ea-8e1f-e47f57940dfd.png)


## Skill Categorization & Correlation

Each [app/game](https://eng.elimu.ai/apps) on the elimu.ai platform is categorized by which literacy/numeracy it teaches, and each skill (and its corresponding collection of apps/games) is gradually unlocked for every type of skill:

## Best-Practices

The elimu.ai software is designed following best-practices from the [Reading Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/course/reading-essentials/) course by Helen Abadzi.


## Personal Learning Device üì±

For _personalized learning_ to be truly effective, each child should have their own Android device. The elimu.ai software is designed to automatically adapt the educational content and [apps](https://eng.elimu.ai/apps) to the current knowledge level of the child. So if another child uses the same user account on the same Android device, the personalized learning will not work.

At the very least, a separate Android device _user profile_ should be created for each child if they have to share the same device. For more information on how Android user management works, see [Supporting Multiple Users &#124; Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user). | ![Multi-User-Android-One](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15718174/83320709-9fde1e80-a27c-11ea-9201-83d0a1726914.jpg)
