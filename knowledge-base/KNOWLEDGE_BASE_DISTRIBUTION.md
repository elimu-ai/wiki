### How to distribute a new Android app/game

For a new Android app to be distributed through the [elimu.ai Appstore](https://github.com/elimu-ai/appstore), you will first have to add the app for each language deployment:

1. http://eng.elimu.ai/application/list
2. http://hin.elimu.ai/application/list
3. http://tgl.elimu.ai/application/list
4. http://tha.elimu.ai/application/list
5. http://vie.elimu.ai/application/list

Press the "+" button and type the package name of your app. Then select the literacy skill or numeracy skill that the app is teaching, and press "Add."

Then upload the signed APK file of your latest release version.

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of handling releases of your app manually, we recommend you configure an automated release workflow (see [example](https://github.com/elimu-ai/vitabu/blob/main/.github/workflows/gradle-release.yml)).
