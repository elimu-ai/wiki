## Software Engineering Principles üìù

### Maintainability

As an open-source organization, it is extra important that we design our software in such a way that new engineers are able to understand and maintain the code. Therefore, when building our software product, we follow these three design principles:

> [!NOTE]
> 1. **Operability**
> 
>    Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.
>
> 2. **Simplicity**
>
>    Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity as possible from the system.
>
> 3. **Evolvability**
>
>    Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change.

### How to test `-SNAPSHOT` versions of internal libraries

See documentation per repo:
* `ai.elimu:model` (`// TODO`)
* [`ai.elimu.analytics:utils`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/analytics/blob/main/README.md#how-to-test--snapshot-versions-of-the-utils-library)
* [`ai.elimu.appstore:utils`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/appstore/blob/main/README.md#how-to-test--snapshot-versions-of-the-utils-library)
* [`ai.elimu.content-provider:utils`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/content-provider/blob/main/README.md#how-to-test--snapshot-versions-of-the-utils-library)
* [`ai.elimu.common-utils:utils`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/common-utils/blob/main/README.md#how-to-publish-a-snapshot-for-local-development--testing)

### How to collaborate on Git branches where `force-push` was used

If you are peer-reviewing a pull request which gets force-pushed after your initial review, use the following commands to synchronize your local branch:

```
git reset --hard
git fetch
git pull --rebase origin <branch name>
```

### Library dependencies

Some Android apps depend on other elimu.ai Android apps to be installed. See 
[flowchart](https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki/blob/main/SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md#library-dependencies).

### Data Collection

To get an understanding of how data is collected from the Android apps, see https://github.com/elimu-ai/ml-datasets/blob/main/README.md#data-sources

#### How to make changes to the way data is stored

If you, for example, want to collect an additional piece of data, note that the backend first needs to be prepared to handle this. As an example, let's say you want to add a new column (e.g. `task_difficulty_level`) to the word assessment events CSV file generated by the elimu.ai Analytics app: [`ExportEventsToCsvWorker.kt`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/analytics/blob/main/app/src/main/java/ai/elimu/analytics/task/ExportEventsToCsvWorker.kt)

```diff
val csvFormat = CSVFormat.DEFAULT
.withHeader(
    "id",
    "time",
    "android_id",
    "package_name",
    "word_id",
    "word_text",
    "mastery_score",
+    "task_difficulty_level",
    "time_spent_ms"
)
```

In this case, you should be aware that data gets extracted from the CSV files in the backend's [`CsvAnalyticsExtractionHelper`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/webapp/blob/main/src/main/java/ai/elimu/util/csv/CsvAnalyticsExtractionHelper.java). So for your new data column to be included, you will have to prepare that code to handle the new data format _before_ you release a new version of the Analytics app.

Example:

```java
Integer taskDifficultyLevel = Long.valueOf(csvRecord.get("task_difficulty_level"));
wordAssessmentEvent.setTaskDifficultyLevel(taskDifficultyLevel);
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that adding this will cause the code to crash for data collected from devices running an older version of the Analytics app. Therefore, you first need to check the version of the Analytics app:
> ```java
> if (versionCode >= 3002025) {
>     Integer taskDifficultyLevel = Long.valueOf(csvRecord.get("task_difficulty_level"));
>     wordAssessmentEvent.setTaskDifficultyLevel(taskDifficultyLevel);
> }
> ```

## Game Development üïπÔ∏è

Most of our games use Cocos2d-x as their game engine:

| Game | Game Engine |
| -------- | -------- |
| [VoltAir](https://github.com/elimu-ai/VoltAir) | Qt |
| [Nya's Space Quest](https://github.com/elimu-ai/nyas-space-quest) | Cocos2d-x |
| [Nya's Space Quest: Quantity Discrimination](https://github.com/elimu-ai/nyas-space-quest-qd) | Cocos2d-x |
| [Seaworld](https://github.com/elimu-ai/seaworld) | Cocos2d-x |
| [Walezi](https://github.com/elimu-ai/walezi-android) | Pandam |
| Kitkit School (mainapp) | Cocos2d-x |
| [Sima](https://github.com/elimu-ai/sima) | Cocos2d-x |
