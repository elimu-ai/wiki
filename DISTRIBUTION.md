### Distribution ðŸ“¦

When distributing the learning software, there are two main questions that need to be answered:
   1. Does the child already have access to an **Android device**?
   1. Does the device have access to an **Internet connection**?

Based on the answers to the above questions, the following are the necessary steps for distributing the software:

1. If a child already has access to an Android device _and_ access to an Internet connection, the household (e.g. parents) can download and install the software by:
   * Download the [elimu.ai Appstore](https://github.com/elimu-ai/appstore).
   * Install and launch the Appstore. Then select the child's [mother tongue](PEDAGOGY.md) as the language of instruction.
   * Use the Appstore to download all the required infrastructural and literacy/numeracy apps/games. (See [SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION.md](SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION.md))

1. If a child already has access to an Android device, but _no_ access to an Internet connection, the software can be installed by:
   * Download a ZIP file from https://elimu.ai/download meant for _offline_ installation. This file contains the latest version of all the Android apps/games, educational content, as well as an installation script (Unix/Windows).
   * Bring the file, a laptop, and a USB cable to the household.
   * Connect the USB cable to the Android device, and execute the installation script in order to automatically install all the Android APK files and content.

1. If a child does _not_ already have access to an Android device:
   * Obtain an Android device with 6" display or larger. Make sure the Android version installed on the device is [supported](https://github.com/elimu-ai/appstore#what-devices-are-being-used) by the elimu.ai software.
   * Download the [elimu.ai Appstore](https://github.com/elimu-ai/appstore).
   * Install and launch the Appstore. Then select the child's [mother tongue](PEDAGOGY.md) as the language of instruction.
   * Use the Appstore to download all the required infrastructural and literacy/numeracy apps/games. (See [SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION.md](SOFTWARE_INSTALLATION.md))
   * Bring the device to the household.
