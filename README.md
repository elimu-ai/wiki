### Purpose

The purpose of [elimu.ai](https://elimu.ai) is to provide disadvantaged children with access to quality basic education.

### Why? 🌍

According to a report from UNESCO, more than [387 million children](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs46-more-than-half-children-not-learning-en-2017.pdf) of primary school age (about 6 to 11 years old) are not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. We believe that a quality basic education is the right of _every child_, no matter her social or geographical background.

> ❝Schooling does not always lead to learning. Worldwide, there are more non-learners in school than out of school.❞
> 
> ⸺[UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/education)

While 58 million children remain [out-of-school](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/primary-education/), most children not learning are _in school_. This is truly a global learning crisis and a tremendous waste of human potential.

### How Can We Solve the Problem? 💡

Our solution is to develop software for teaching disadvantaged children the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic. A collection of educational apps teaches children basic literacy and numeracy in a fun and engaging way. This empowers each child to learn fully autonomously, and at her own pace, without depending on the availability of qualified teachers.

The [elimu.ai](https://elimu.ai) software is a _platform_ of educational content and Android apps.

The software is designed in such a way that the children can learn fully autonomously, without guidance from qualified teachers. Instead, an AI tutor (Nya) guides each child through the necessary steps. The AI tutor gradually unlocks more advanced content, as the child demonstrates [mastery](PEDAGOGY.md#personalized-learning-) of prerequisite skills. As an example; Before learning how to read a word, the child needs to master the _letter-to-sound correspondence_ of the letters composing that word.
