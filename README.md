### Purpose

The purpose of [elimu.ai](https://elimu.ai) is to solve the global learning crisis—At primary level, 10% of children worldwide are not in school.

### Why? 🌍

We believe that a quality basic education is the right of _every child_, no matter her social or geographical background.

### How Can We Solve the Problem? 💡

Our solution is to build innovative learning software that empowers out-of-school children to _teach themselves_ basic reading📖, writing✍🏽 and math🔢 **within 6 months**.

A collection of educational apps teaches children basic literacy and numeracy in a fun and engaging way. This empowers each child to learn fully autonomously, and at her own pace, without depending on the availability of qualified teachers.

The [elimu.ai](https://elimu.ai) software is a _platform_ of educational content and Android apps.

### Autonomous Learning

The software is designed in such a way that the children can learn fully autonomously (alone or in a group), without guidance from qualified teachers. Instead, an AI tutor (Nya) guides each child through the necessary steps. The AI tutor gradually unlocks more advanced content, as the child demonstrates [mastery](PEDAGOGY.md#personalized-learning-) of prerequisite skills. As an example; Before learning how to read a word, the child needs to master the _sound-letter correspondence_ of each sound composing that word.
