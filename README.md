### Purpose

The purpose of [elimu.ai](http://elimu.ai) is to provide disadvantaged children with access to quality basic education.

### Why? üåç

According to a report from UNESCO, more than [387 million children](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/fs46-more-than-half-children-not-learning-en-2017.pdf) of primary school age (about 6 to 11 years old) are not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. We believe that a quality basic education is the right of _every child_, no matter her social or geographical background.

> ‚ùùSchooling does not always lead to learning. Worldwide, there are more non-learners in school than out of school.‚ùû

> ‚∏∫[UNICEF](https://www.unicef.org/education)

While 58 million children remain [out-of-school](https://data.unicef.org/topic/education/primary-education/), most children not learning are _in school_. This is truly a global learning crisis and a tremendous waste of human potential.

### How Can We Solve the Problem? üí°

Our solution is to develop software for teaching disadvantaged children the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic. A collection of [educational apps](https://eng.elimu.ai/apps) teaches children basic literacy and numeracy in a fun and engaging way. This empowers each child to learn fully autonomously, and at her own pace, without depending on the availability of qualified teachers.

The [elimu.ai](http://elimu.ai) software is a _platform_ of educational content and Android [apps](https://eng.elimu.ai/apps).

The software is designed in such a way that the children can learn fully autonomously, without guidance from qualified teachers. Instead, an AI tutor (Nya) guides each child through the necessary steps. The AI tutor gradually unlocks more advanced content, as the child demonstrates [mastery](PEDAGOGY.md#personalized-learning-) of prerequisite skills. As an example; Before learning how to read a word, the child needs to master the _letter-to-sound correspondence_ of the letters composing that word.

## Milestones üìÜ

### 12-Month [Action Plan](https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki/projects) (2021 ‚Üí 2022)

Objective: Build initial [Hindi](https://hin.elimu.ai) & [Filipino](https://fil.elimu.ai) curriculum of literacy/numeracy apps.

See https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki/projects

### Long-Term Plan (2022 ‚Üí 2030)

In the long term, apps and content will be created first for target languages where the number of children without access to quality basic education is the highest (based on [UIS Statistics](http://data.uis.unesco.org/)):

Country | Languages | Out-of-School Children (Primary Age)
------------ | ------------- | ------------:
India | [Hindi](https://hin.elimu.ai), Bengali, Urdu | 2,887,748 (as of 2013)
Indonesia | Indonesian, Javanese | 1,767,974 (as of 2013)
Tanzania | Swahili | 1,370,468 (as of 2013)
South Africa | Xhosa | 845,478 (as of 2018)

## Would You Like to Contribute? üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

How can you contribute? Either by _adding educational content_ or by _developing Android apps/games_ for the children to interact with the educational content. In addition, you can contribute by _testing_ the software, and by _distributing_ the software.

### Option 1: Download & Test the Software üì¶üïµüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

For instructions on how to download and install the software, see the [elimu.ai Appstore](https://github.com/elimu-ai/appstore).

### Option 2: Content Creation or App Development üé∂üéôÔ∏èüì±

  * Contribute by creating or peer reviewing educational content (e.g. storybooks, words, audio recordings, images, etc). If you speak Hindi or Filipino as your mother tongue, go to the website matching your language and then click "Sign On":

    * https://hin.elimu.ai
    * https://fil.elimu.ai

    For instructions on how to add educational content, see [LOCALIZATION.md](LOCALIZATION.md#add-educational-content).

  * Also, contribute by developing Android applications or Android games. If you are a developer, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md](SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Option 3: Software & Hardware Distribution üõµüí®

Do you live near a child who does not have access to quality basic education? Help us [distribute](https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki/blob/main/SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md#distribution) the learning software. For more information, send an e-mail to info@elimu.ai or contact us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/9rz4XYJJDE).

### Donate Cryptocurrency (`$ETH`)

Your are also welcome to [donate](https://eng.elimu.ai/contributions/donate) cryptocurrency to support the work of our content creators, engineers and distributors. Funds received from donors and the DAO treasury are paid out each month to contributors who provided value to the community:

<a name="open-source"></a>
## Open Source

All the code and content is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/elimu-ai) and on our [website](http://elimu.ai) as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).

The licenses we have chosen allow anybody to use the software however they want. Our goal is to spread the solution quickly in order to reach as many children as possible, and we believe that using open source software will enable this. Any individual, company or organization is welcome to take the existing code and adapt it to their local needs, as well as adding improvements to the original code if they wish to do so.

### Global Community üåê

As a global and open-minded community, we invite people of any background to join us in our work. Being global citizens, we don't want a world that is differentiating people's basic human rights by their location/religion/ethnicity. Why, for example, should a child's place of birth matter when it comes to whether or not she will get access to quality basic education?

We deeply believe that all children should have access to a quality basic education no matter their social or geographic background. Please help us make this a reality by making a contribution of your time and knowledge towards this purpose. Thank you! üíú
