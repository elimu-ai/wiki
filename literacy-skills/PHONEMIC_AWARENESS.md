[`LiteracySkill.PHONEMIC_AWARENESS`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/model/blob/main/src/main/java/ai/elimu/model/v2/enums/content/LiteracySkill.java)

> Phonemic awareness enables children to separate words into sounds and blend sounds into words, oral skills that are necessary precursors to decoding and spelling.
> One way to measure phonemic awareness is to present children with a word orally and ask them to pronounce only the first sound of the word.
