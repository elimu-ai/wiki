# 🎵 Syllable Naming

[`LiteracySkill.SYLLABLE_NAMING`](https://github.com/elimu-ai/model/blob/main/src/main/java/ai/elimu/model/v2/enums/content/LiteracySkill.java)

> A student's ability to identify legal syllables presented in random order.
> 
> In languages with limited legal syllable combinations, assessing nearly all of the more frequent syllable combinations can be done
> within a standard 50- or 100-item assessment (e.g., in Kiswahili, legal combinations containing the letter “k” would include “ka,” “ke,” “ki,”
> “ko,” and “ku”). Students are asked to name as many syllables as they can in 1 minute. The syllables are listed in random order, 10 syllables to a row.
> Syllables are selected for the instrument based on the frequency with which they occur in the language in question and are randomly
> ordered; legal syllable combinations that are **actual words are avoided**.

> [!NOTE]
> Syllable-based languages may incorporate syllable naming and syllable segmentation subtasks rather than letter naming and letter sounds.
> Early reading assessments in early grades often include syllable naming as part of
> [phonological awareness](https://github.com/elimu-ai/wiki/blob/main/literacy-skills/PHONEMIC_AWARENESS.md) and decoding skills.
